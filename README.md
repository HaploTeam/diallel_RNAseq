#Diallel RNAseq analysis repository

## Scripts
 - merging_raw_counts.R : merges the read counts of different alleles of the same genes to produce the read counts that were used in all subsequent analyses.
 - preparing_tpm_for_GWAS.R : transforms the tpm values to a format that is compatible with Fast-LMM.
 - making_all_figures.R : Produces figures for the description of the dataset, heritability, genome-wide heritability and GWAS results.
 - making_SV_figures.R : Produces the figures for the structural variants identified in the parental isolates as well as the SV-GWAS.
